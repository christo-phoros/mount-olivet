Hello there, my name is Christopher.

My name originates in Greece and means "bearer of the announced one" which practically describes the very purpose of the Mount Olivet. I have created this blog-like site to collect all my thoughts on becoming an aware Christian. No matter who you are, I hope it will be kind of food for thoughts and for those who are still in doubt I will be able to bring you closer to Christ and his teachings.
