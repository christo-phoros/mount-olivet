### What you'll hear in church

* Go to church
* Give in to church
* Listen to your priest / pastor
* Read the Bible, but stick to priest's / pastor's interpretation
* Pray and you'll get anything you want
* Confess to the priest on regular basis, only he can purge your sins
* Take communion which is a mystic body of the Christ himself
* Say some prayer X times Y times a month and you will get a special blessing

### What the Bible really says

* Love and praise God and be thankful whatever comes in your way (good or bad)
* Love other people - think of someone else before thinking about yourself
* Be a humble, decent person - first give, then take
* Don't overthink helping people, just do it
* Don't judge people, let calm and love be you answers to aggression and anger
* Don't be greedy - let go of worrying about money and focus
* Don't be afraid of death (yours and your relatives) - it is in fact a prize for all Christ disciples
* Show others that one can actually live that way and it brings unbelievable results
* Seek of Him and his advice anytime (it actually works!)

**God bless**<br>
